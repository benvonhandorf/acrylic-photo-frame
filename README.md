## Overview

A simple project that is designed to provide interesting animations for an edge-lit laser-cut acrylic photo.

The project is written in micropython and was originally built in 2017.  It appears to still work properly in a 2022 vintage of Micropython.

## Hardware

The hardware is a custom ESP8266 board driving a single strip of APA102 addressable LEDs which is woven back and forth across 5 layers each of which is aligned with one of the 5 layers of the laser-cut photograph.
